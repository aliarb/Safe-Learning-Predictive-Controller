# Safe-Learning-Predictive-Controller
Safety-Guaranteed Learning-Predictive Control for Aggressive Autonomous Vehicle Maneuvers, • Developed an autonomous driving controller for aggressive vehicle maneuvers • The controller maximizes the safety region of vehicle maneuvers • Gaussian process model is used to improve the control performance • Sum-of-Square is used to estimate the safety boundary
